## Introduction
 This is Tic Tac Toe Game desiged in C Programming Language using multifile approach. I have used the concepts of functions and arrays.
 
 This game is a simple game with two players who play to beat each other. It is 3x3 grid game which is played with pen and paper. It is solved game with three definate results two being wins of two players and one being the draw game assuming that both players play best. The player which succeeds to place 3 pieces of same type vertically, horizontally and diagonally he wins the game.

## Research
  This game dates backs to the Roman empire around first century BC which was played using only three pebbles.The first print reference to "noughts and crosses" (nought being an alternative word for zero), the British name, appeared in 1858, in an issue of Notes and Queries. The first print reference to a game called "tick-tack-toe" occurred in 1884, but referred to "a children's game played on a slate, consisting in trying with the eyes shut to bring the pencil down on one of the numbers of a set, the number hit being scored".

## Cost and Features
 Main features of this game are that it can be played by the user any number of times. After the end of each game user is asked if he want to play it again. 
 
 It uses minimal disk space and memory because it is a console application and can be run on any low end computer easily compared to other high end graphical games which require more memory and disk space.
